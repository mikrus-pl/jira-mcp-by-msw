# This file is for LOCAL development/run.
# If you run this server via an MCP client, you can set the same variables in the MCP server config `env`.
# You do NOT need to set credentials in both places.

# Jira Cloud site URL (copy from browser, no trailing slash)
JIRA_BASE_URL=https://your-domain.atlassian.net

# Auth option A (recommended for Jira Cloud)
JIRA_EMAIL=you@example.com
JIRA_API_TOKEN=your_api_token

# Auth option B (advanced): provide full Authorization header value
# JIRA_AUTH_HEADER=Basic <base64(email:api_token)>
# JIRA_AUTH_HEADER=Bearer <token>

# Request timeout (ms). Protects the MCP client from long-hanging Jira requests.
JIRA_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=20000

# Severity mapping (optional)
# Many Jira projects use a custom field for Severity. If you want the server to read/write Severity,
# set the field id (often looks like customfield_12345).
#
# How to find it (requires auth):
#   curl -sS -u "${JIRA_EMAIL}:${JIRA_API_TOKEN}" "${JIRA_BASE_URL}/rest/api/3/field" | head
#
# JIRA_SEVERITY_FIELD_ID=customfield_12345
#
# JQL field used by `jira_search_issues` when filtering by severity.
# Typically the same as JIRA_SEVERITY_FIELD_ID.
# JIRA_SEVERITY_JQL_FIELD=customfield_12345
#
# How to send severity when setting/updating:
# - option: select-list (sends { value: "..." }) [default]
# - string: free-text (sends "...")
# - number: numeric (sends 123)
# JIRA_SEVERITY_VALUE_TYPE=option
